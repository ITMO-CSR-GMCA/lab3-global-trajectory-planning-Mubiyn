## Method Description

### Overview
The **Potential Field Method** is a classical approach for robot path planning that treats the robot as a particle moving under the influence of artificial forces. This implementation uses a hybrid approach combining potential fields with RRT* fallback for improved reliability.

### Mathematical Foundation

#### Attractive Potential
The attractive potential uses a quadratic function that increases with distance from the goal:

```
U_att(q) = ½ × k_att × ||q - q_goal||²
```

Where:
- `k_att` is the attractive gain coefficient (2.0)
- `q` is the current position
- `q_goal` is the goal position

The corresponding attractive force is:
```
F_att(q) = -∇U_att(q) = k_att × (q_goal - q)
```

#### Repulsive Potential
The repulsive potential uses an inverse function that becomes large near obstacle boundaries:

```
U_rep(q) = ½ × k_rep × (1/d(q) - 1/d₀)²   if d(q) ≤ d₀
U_rep(q) = 0                               if d(q) > d₀
```

Where:
- `k_rep` is the repulsive gain coefficient (8.0)
- `d(q)` is the distance from the robot to the nearest obstacle
- `d₀` is the influence distance of the obstacle (1.8m)

#### Hybrid Algorithm
The implementation uses a hybrid approach:
1. **Primary**: Potential field method with gradient descent
2. **Fallback**: RRT* algorithm if potential field fails (local minima)

### Algorithm Advantages
- Smooth paths due to continuous potential functions
- Real-time capability for dynamic environments
